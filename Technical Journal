8/1/18: Mobile friendly Blog
  - Changed a couple sizes on the inbetween resolutions for blog, as well as smaller and larger resolutions. 
  - Made two different pages for the mobile-blog, one that is full-page and one that is only about 75%. Gonna see which one she likes more (full page looks better to me). 
  - I believe contact page is already mobile but will check that. If that is complete then the next thing i'll do is JS for all the pages. 
  

8/1/18: Mobile friendly Books
  - Put books page into same format as the other pages (blog-like formula, with or without borders)
  - Made media queries for smaller and larger resolutions. 
  - Still not sure about font being same width as book, may need to make change, will see what katie says about it (Will also need to ask what she would like in terms of font alignment on large resolution). 
  **Next**
      -Blog page: Same thing, media queries and touchups (Make sure navbar and footer are exact same, font-size is same across pages, etc).

7/31/18 : Mobile Friendly Cont.
  - Moved onto about page, making it mobile friendly. 
  - Have things about where I want it to show Katie. May move div down slightly (Add padding?) removed borders. 
  - Making container div and item div height  = 100% to make border stay at the bottom, instead of using vh or px. (Can use vw as well, but then have chance of leaving too much space between container and footer)

7/25/18 : Mobile Friendly
  - Made page friendly to larger pages by reducing the size of pretty much everything (pictures, div sizes, font, etc).
  - Looking at making this mobile friendly. Thinking that I could just develop a separate container that is made for mobile (a simplified version of the page) and just use javascript to hide essentially the whole other webpage and show the one speicifically for mobile?
  - Would it be easier to do it that way or just alter the size and structure of everything on the page? I would like to have everything in a single column. Starting with "latest" div, then author div and finally the reader board (Or just upcoming events). (Subscribe at the bottom of the page?)
  *UPDATE* Wasn't too bad altering current divs. Changed flexbox from into column form instead of row on "inner" div. With nowrap to put into one line. Sizing hasn't been too much of an issue. Just need to work on the reader-board div now. (Latest and author divs pretty much there!)

7/21/18 : Re-doing changes 
  - Didn't like the changes I made originally, will start over and branch it. Will ultimately just try using smaller font and ridding the page of padding in the containers. 

7/20/18 : Contact Page
  -Working on the page, I think I will have to make everything smaller when the resolution gets higher, the full page looks stretched. Need to just make everything compact and take advatage of the white space.
      o Too much padding between the social media links at the top. If I remove that padding and move the boxes upwards, make font-size somewhat smaller and reduce the size of the boxes, will seem less stretched. 

7/17/18 : E-mail section
  -Looked into making an e-mail section properly work in the contact section. 
  -Sounds like I will have to either base it in a server-side language (PHP or ASP) or use Google scripts <https://github.com/dwyl/html-form-send-email-via-google-script-without-server#how>
  -Once I figure that out, I will have to make a checking system to ensure security of message to Katie.
  -Also, may need to implement a way to ensure e-mail actually exists (slow down spam) and maybe add some sort of bot check?
  **To do:
      o Will need to figure out how to make submit actually send the e-mail
      o Make a basic security for textarea
      o Make a check of the user e-mail to make sure it exists. 

7/13/18
  -Had meeting with Katie today about the website. Discussed the e-mail I had sent her and made some notes accordingly. 
  -Decisions: 
    *Have every page that could be formatted like the blog, formatted like the blog. 
    *Make navbar items spaced evenly instead of having name isolated and everything else spaced evenly. 
    *Nothing really on the footer, will include some sort of "made by: darryn reinertson" or something
    *Have things centered and try to keep things consistent between each page. 
    *Contact page to have link to insta (that's it currently) and text fields for viewer's e-mail and textfield that will get sent to her e-mail. 
  -Specifics: 
    *ALL: 
         - Flex-grow on navbar down to 1.5 from 4. 
         - 50vw center instead of 60vw. sides 25vw. 

     About: Center texts within #about-main
            - off left text (paragraphs). 
            - flex-grow on navbar down to 1.5 from 4.
            - remove pictures. 

     Blog : 
          - Pictures and text have some padding on left and right.
          - 50vw instead of 60vw. Keep main part the same width across each page. 
          - Bottom border to solid line instead of dashes
     Books  :
          - Put books into blog format, 50vw with 25vw sides. Book on top of text. 
     Contact:
          - Same structure, no borders on middle div. 
          - Instagram tag, "Leave a message", input field for visitors email, input field to send email to Kate. Send button that submits
  -Next:
      *Will put together contact section with textfields (will add javascript later that will make areas work). 
      *Will need to form books section into blog format with pictures above the text
      *Work on mobile versions of each page. 

  -Problem: 
      *Couldn't figure out why footer was acting weird. Currently, when page is much wider than it is tall, footer is taking place in middle of page. This is because the bottom of the main-container is where the footer is, but text and such is bleeding over the boundaries of the container. That's why it appears the footer is taking place in the middle, it's staying at the bottom of the container. Will need to figure out how to adjust the height based upon the text and pictures within?
      *Can make height in vw's in order to ensure height of container adjusts with width of screen?
