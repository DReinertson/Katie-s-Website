  -Had meeting with Katie today about the website. Discussed the e-mail I had sent her and made some notes accordingly. 
  -Decisions: 
    *Have every page that could be formatted like the blog, formatted like the blog. 
    *Make navbar items spaced evenly instead of having name isolated and everything else spaced evenly. 
    *Nothing really on the footer, will include some sort of "made by: darryn reinertson" or something
    *Have things centered and try to keep things consistent between each page. 
    *Contact page to have link to insta (that's it currently) and text fields for viewer's e-mail and textfield that will get sent to her e-mail. 
  -Specifics: 
    *ALL: 
         - Flex-grow on navbar down to 1.5 from 4. 
         - 50vw center instead of 60vw. sides 25vw. 

     About: Center texts within #about-main

            - remove pictures. 

     Blog : 
          - Pictures and text have some padding on left and right.
          - 50vw instead of 60vw. Keep main part the same width across each page. 
          - Bottom border to solid line instead of dashes
     Books  :
          - Put books into blog format, 50vw with 25vw sides. Book on top of text. 
     Contact:
          - Same structure, no borders on middle div. 
          - Instagram tag, "Leave a message", input field for visitors email, input field to send email to Kate. Send button that submits
