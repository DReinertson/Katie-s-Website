  -Had meeting with Katie today about the website. Discussed the e-mail I had sent her and made some notes accordingly. 
  -Decisions: 
    *Have every page that could be formatted like the blog, formatted like the blog. 
    *Make navbar items spaced evenly instead of having name isolated and everything else spaced evenly. 
    *Nothing really on the footer, will include some sort of "made by: darryn reinertson" or something
    *Have things centered and try to keep things consistent between each page. 
    *Contact page to have link to insta (that's it currently) and text fields for viewer's e-mail and textfield that will get sent to her e-mail. 
  -Specifics: 
    *ALL: 
         - Flex-grow on navbar down to 1.5 from 4. 
         - 50vw center instead of 60vw. sides 25vw. 

     About: Center texts within #about-main
            - off left text (paragraphs). 
            - flex-grow on navbar down to 1.5 from 4.
            - remove pictures. 

     Blog : 
          - Pictures and text have some padding on left and right.
          - 50vw instead of 60vw. Keep main part the same width across each page. 
          - Bottom border to solid line instead of dashes
     Books  :
          - Put books into blog format, 50vw with 25vw sides. Book on top of text. 
     Contact:
          - Same structure, no borders on middle div. 
          - Instagram tag, "Leave a message", input field for visitors email, input field to send email to Kate. Send button that submits
  -Next:
      *Will put together contact section with textfields (will add javascript later that will make areas work). 
      *Will need to form books section into blog format with pictures above the text
      *Work on mobile versions of each page. 

  -Problem: 
      *Couldn't figure out why footer was acting weird. Currently, when page is much wider than it is tall, footer is taking place in middle of page. This is because the bottom of the main-container is where the footer is, but text and such is bleeding over the boundaries of the container. That's why it appears the footer is taking place in the middle, it's staying at the bottom of the container. Will need to figure out how to adjust the height based upon the text and pictures within?
      *Can make height in vw's in order to ensure height of container adjusts with width of screen?
